10 steps you must take in order to help ensure #5G deployment success for your organization.

» Step 1: Ensure that devices meet 3GPP standards, industry regulations & your network requirements. Each release of the 5G standard introduces new capabilities that require new technologies. Ensure that your devices meet 3GPP standards, as well as any relevant industry regulations & your unique network requirements.

» Step 2: Assess the cybersecurity hygiene of 5G devices.The attack surface grows exponentially with billions of connected mobile devices, Internet of Things (IoT) devices & Wi-Fi networks & endpoints. Assess the cybersecurity posture of your 5G devices thoroughly & frequently.

» Step 3: Verify device connectivity performance for an optimal user experience. 5G devices will access different radio access technologies (RATs), including 5G New Radio (NR), 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) & Wi-Fi. Operators need to evaluate real-world performance & handovers between radio networks. This real-world evaluation is known as the inter-RAT handover test.

» Step 4: Check that radio access network (RAN) elements conform to specifications. Before release into the market, all 5G devices & base stations must meet a minimum level of performance. 3GPP & the O-RAN Alliance define what & how to measure for compliance against the core specifications.

» Step 5: Perform interoperability testing for seamless interaction. O-RAN brings the disaggregation of 5G base stations into various elements. Validating interoperability & performance against expected use models helps ensure seamless interaction.

» Step 6: Stress your RAN & core networks with 5G traffic. Ensure that your RAN & core networks meet your high performance, low latency & robust reliability requirements under load.

» Step 7: Ensure that your infrastructure runs in a virtual, cloudified environment. To migrate from 5G non-standalone (NSA) to standalone (SA), you need to take advantage of network functions virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) &
virtualized network functions (VNF), using virtualization, containerization & cloud technologies.

» Step 8: Measure & analyze the air interface in the field. The physical layer standards in 5G NR Release 15 & beyond define a flexible air interface to support the many use cases expected in 5G. Field test your air interface to ensure that it performs as expected.

» Step 9: Test your network with real devices to assess performance. Stress test your network with 5G user equipment (UE) traffic under different use case scenarios to ensure that it meets key performance metrics like high data throughput, reliability &low latency.

» Step 10: Observe 5G traffic to ensure high QoE for subscribers. 5G & O-RAN increase the number of interfaces in mobile networks & the specifications leave room for interpretation. Ensure complete observability using precise data correlation & analytics.
